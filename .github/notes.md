### ‚úÖ What this enables:

- **Domain clarity:** Copilot knows exactly which properties, endpoints, and patterns to scaffold.
- **MongoDB üëç:** It will wire up `IOptions<MongoDbSettings>`, `IMongoCollection<Customer>`, & Docker support correctly.
- **Validation & REST:** Ensures GUID handling, field constraints, and endpoint definitions match requirements.

---

Next steps? I can help you scaffold:

- `Customer` model & validation attributes
- `MongoDbSettings` class
- `CustomerService` repository layer with CRUD
- controller or minimal API endpoints
- `docker-compose.yml` with MongoDB & service
- Unit test project setup

Just let me know which you'd like to start with!
